## About me
My name is Irene Majer. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca. I'm actually a student of the Bioinformatics and computational genomics course held by @Università di Milano and @Politecnico di Milano. In my page you will find the repository for my university projects. Feel free to contact me in case there are errors or improvements to be made. I would really appreciate it. :heart:


## My interests
I -really- like Biology, Statistic and Informatics. I have a particular interest in neurogenomics and -omics in general. 
I would like to learn more and more about these topics!
