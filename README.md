My name is Irene Majer. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Milano-Bicocca. I am currently a student in the Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics program offered by the University of Milan and the Polytechnic University of Milan.

I would greatly appreciate it. :heart:
